# Visualizing Indian Domestic Passenger Air Traffic

## Introduction
India's domestic passenger air traffic is growing at a rapid pace with not just more flights but also more cities that one can fly in and out of (https://bit.ly/2wUUBEF). This growth in traffic has ramifications beyond the airline industry as travellers drive demand for allied services like rapid road transportation (taxis, buses, trains) and hotels. There are also negative consequences of the growth like road traffic congestion at certain hours and warped real estate prices as large businesses "drive out" residents and small businesses from prime locations on the airport routes. 

This project aims to visualize the patterns of domestic air traffic in India and glean insights that might help city administrators and businesses understand the ebb and flow of air traffic to their cities and perhaps come up with strategies to better service the growing number of travellers.

## Data Sources
All airlines file flight schedule details with the governing authority, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The primary data source for this project are these flight schedules filed by the airlines and published by the DGCA (https://bit.ly/2T6Od5T). Airlines file these schedules for two seasons a year: Winter Schedule and Summer Schedule and frequently update these schedules even within a season. The data for this project was downloaded from the DGCA website in the first week of February 2020 and is current as of that week.

The list of IATA codes for cities was downloaded (with thanks) from https://ourairports.com/data/.
